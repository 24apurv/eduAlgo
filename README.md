## Objective 
A python package published at [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)

## Aim Of The Package

This is a very simple python package made with python script to study different algorithms for educational purposes. This package is under **planning** version and aims to achieve the following,

* Contain All the available algorithms
* Help students with learning space and time complexity
* Visualizing Algorithms
* Getting resources, articles etc to study about python and Algorithms
* Become a handy tool for the programmers while using different algorithms on daily basis

## Current Algorithms

* Bubble sort
* Selection sort

## Algorithms Yet to Publish

* Searching Algorithms and Visualizations
* Sorting Algorithms and Visualizations
* Graph Algorithms and Visualizations
* Linked List Implementations and Vizualizations
* Tree Types, Vizualizations and Implementations

## Installation

Fast install:

    pip install eduAlgo

Example

```python

    from edualgo import algorithm.sort

    arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
    obj = sort()
    sorted_arr = obj.bubble_sort(arr)
    print(sorted_arr)
```
Here is the output:

       [1,2,3,4,5]
